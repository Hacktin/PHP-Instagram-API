**PHP-Instagram-API
Normally,I didn't really know anything about PHP but ı searched to how ı can use instagram api to php from Google :D .And that's it ,ı understood to how ı can take the json by Rest-API and a little basic syntax of PHP  :D**

**İf you want to use Instagram-API from your php or another application,you must have access token.
Before that you must had instagram account and after that you had to created a new client.Because when you finish to create a new client,
you will have client_id and redirect_url or web_site_url and use these properties for be competent to instagram-api.** 

**Anyway,now ı have a question:--How ı can be competent to instagram-api?---
First of all,you have to use this authorization url=>
https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=myclientId&redirect_uri=mywebSiteUrl&response_type=token**

**client id is (your client id) and redirect_uri is (your web site link or url) from your client**

**After this,you have to request with this url and it will appear give a permission button or give a authorization button or something like this.
You should click this button and it will return your web site or redirect your url.But this time your redirect url will have little difference.
What's that??İt's an access token :D**

**Okey ı will share some image from 
Issues about how can you take an access token :D**
